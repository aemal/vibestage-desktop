# Vibestage Electron Overlay

## Project Overview

This project is an Electron-based desktop application that creates a transparent overlay on top of all your screens, displaying large animated emojis at random positions. The overlay is always on top and click-through, allowing you to interact with your desktop and other applications while the emoji animation runs.

**Purpose**: VibeStage is an audience engagement tool designed for presentations and workshops. The presenter runs the overlay on their screen while the audience gets access to the remote control, allowing them to share their vibes and reactions in real-time. This creates an interactive and engaging experience where the audience can express their emotions, feedback, and energy through emojis and special effects that appear on the presenter's screen.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by [Vibestage](https://github.com/aemal/vibestage), which is a web-based interactive emoji wall platform developed as part of the Vibe Coding 101 Crash Course by Aemal Sayer ([aemalsayer.com](https://aemalsayer.com)).

- **Original Vibestage**: A web app for real-time, interactive emoji walls at events, with mobile controller and real-time sync.
- **This Project**: A desktop overlay app that runs natively on your computer, showing animated emojis on top of all screens, independent of browsers or web servers.
